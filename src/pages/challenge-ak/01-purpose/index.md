While I've been blogging the past few years as a creative outlet, (https://sarkelviajero.wordpress.com) this will be my first go around at writing about my coding fun.

This last winter I spent a good deal of time volunteering with Challenge Alaska, a fantastic organization that helps empower those with disabilities to tackle the slopes. With a staff of only 4, they manage hundreds of volunteers that keep the lessons running without a hitch. I took some mental notes and have created a plan of attack to hopefully make their lives easier.

Features:
* Lesson availibility calendar

   Give volunteers the ability to check for open lessons and sign up, freeing up time for staff.

* Admin portal

  Allow staff access to admin functionality. Edit lesson calendar, calculate volunteer hours/awards.

* Email reminders

  Automatically Notify volunteers of their upcoming lessons via email. SendGrid or MailChimp integration.

* Donation

  Promote the ease of donating to ChallengeAK via stripe/paypal.

* Media Sharing

  Allow volunteers to share photos and video of their lessons with students and their family.
